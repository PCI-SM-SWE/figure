##Getting Started
Standard MEAN application. Assuming you have Node and NPM installed and working correctly...

```
npm install
npm install -g bower

bower install
bower install papaparse

grunt serve
```

You can then view your app at http://hostname:3000. It'll most likely open the browser for you!
